# 1. Obesity Is a Hormonal Problem, Not a Calorie Problem

- Weight gain is primarily regulated by hormones, especially insulin, rather than simply by consuming more calories than you burn.  
    Anyone can get fat if insulin is ingested.
    
- Chronic high insulin levels, driven by frequent eating and consumption of refined carbohydrates, lead to fat storage and prevent fat burning.
    
- The hypothalamic region of the brain determines the body set weight—the fat thermostat. 
    

- Insulin acts here to set body-set weight higher. In the short term, we can use various diets to bring our actual body weight down. However, once it falls below the body set weight, the body activates mechanisms to regain that weight—and that’s the long-term problem.
    

# 2. The Role of Insulin

- Insulin is a hormone that helps store glucose as fat. 
    
- Persistently high insulin levels (insulin resistance) cause the body to "lock in" fat stores, making weight loss difficult.
    
- Reducing insulin spikes through dietary changes is more effective than simply cutting calories.
    
- Insulin resistance causes Diabetes.
    

## Mechanics of Digestion

1. When we eat, foods are broken down in the stomach and small intestine:
    

- Carbohydrates, which are chains of sugars, are broken into smaller sugars
    
- Proteins are broken into amino acids
    
- Fats are broken into fatty acids
    
- Dietary fiber is not broken down.  
      
    

2. Blood sugar rises:
    

- Certain foods, particularly refined carbohydrates, raise blood sugar more than other foods
    
- Protein raises insulin levels as well, although its effect on blood sugars is minimal.
    
- Dietary fats tend to raise both blood sugars and insulin levels minimally.  
      
    

3. The rise in blood sugar stimulates insulin release:
    

Hormones are molecules that deliver messages to a target cell. Insulin delivers the message to most human cells to take glucose out of the blood to use for energy.

To deliver this message, hormones must attach to the target cell by binding to receptors on the cell surface, much like a lock and key. Insulin acts on the insulin receptor to bring glucose into the cell. Insulin is the key and fits snugly into the lock (the receptor). The door opens and glucose enters. 

4. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver for quick access (Glycogen Wallet). Once full, excess carbohydrates will be turned into fat cells (Fat Bank)
    

Ingested carbohydrate leads to more glucose being available than needed. Insulin helps move this flood of glucose out of the bloodstream into storage for later use. We store this glucose by turning it into glycogen in the liver—a process is called glycogenesis. (Genesis means “the creation of,” so this term means the creation of glycogen.) Glucose molecules are strung together in long chains to form glycogen. Insulin is the main stimulus of glycogenesis. We can convert glucose to glycogen and back again quite easily.

But the liver has only limited storage space for glycogen. Once full, excess carbohydrates will be turned into fat—a process called de novo lipogenesis.

5. In short-term fasting periods, the body takes energy out of Glycogen (Glycogen Wallet). In long-term fasting periods, the body takes energy out of Fat (Fat Bank)
    

Several hours after a meal, blood sugars and insulin levels start to drop. Less glucose is available for use by the muscles, the brain and other organs. The liver starts to break down glycogen into glucose to release it into general circulation for energy—the glycogen-storage process in reverse. This happens most nights, assuming you don’t eat at night.

Glycogen is easily available, but in limited supply. During a short-term fast (“fast” meaning that you do not eat), your body has enough glycogen available to function. During a prolonged fast, your body can make new glucose from its fat stores—a process called gluconeogenesis (the “making of new sugar”). Fat is burned to release energy, which is then sent out to the body—the fat-storage process in reverse.

Insulin is a storage hormone. Ample intake of food leads to insulin release. Insulin then turns on storage of sugar and fat. When there is no intake of food, insulin levels fall, and burning of sugar and fat is turned on.  
Low insulin levels encourage glycogen and fat burning. Sustained levels of excessive insulin will tend to increase fat storage. An imbalance between the feeding and fasting will lead to increased insulin, which causes increased fat.

# 3. Common Myths About Obesity

- "Eat less, move more": This approach ignores the body's ability to adjust metabolism in response to calorie restriction. Under-eating triggers two important responses:
    

First, total energy expenditure is immediately and indefinitely reduced in order to conserve the available energy. Second, hormonal hunger signaling is immediately and indefinitely amplified in an effort to acquire more food. Weight loss results in increased hunger and decreased metabolism. This evolutionary survival strategy has a single purpose: to make us regain the lost weight.

Study: Minnesota Starvation Experiment (men dropping their calorie intake resulted in physiological and psychological stress, and less weight gain than expected, as 50% drop in kcal resulted in 40% drop in metabolic rate)

- "All calories are equal": Different foods impact hormones and metabolism differently, with refined carbohydrates causing the most significant insulin spikes.
    

# 4. The Importance of Fasting and Meal Timing

- Fasting is a natural and effective way to reduce insulin levels, promote fat burning, and "reset" the body’s metabolic state.
    
- Constant snacking and eating throughout the day keeps insulin levels elevated, leading to weight gain over time.

# 5. Dietary Recommendations

What to eat is just as important as When to eat.

## What to eat:

- Cut out refined carbohydrates and sugar: These are the primary drivers of insulin spikes and fat storage.
    

- Highly processed carbs cause super spikes in blood sugar and thus insulin.  
      
    Cocaine users will know that very fine powders are absorbed into the bloodstream much faster than coarse grains—that’s what allows for higher “highs,” both for cocaine and for glucose. Refined wheat causes our glucose levels to spike. Insulin levels follow.  
      
    
- Don’t replace sugar with artificial sweeteners, as they also raise insulin as much as sugar and are equally prone to causing obesity.
    
- Fructose is the most dangerous sugar, as the liver doesn’t have an effective mechanism to process it. Watch labels for “fructose syrup” and avoid.  
    E.g. Agave is 80% fructose, Honey is 40% fructose.  
      
    

- Eat healthy fats. Aim to have higher Omega 3 and low Omega 6.  
      
    

- Omega 6s are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are converted to highly inflammatory mediators called eicosanoids.
    

=> These are found in Seed oils (Soybean oil, Corn oil, Sunflower oil, etc), things like Mayo and Margarine - avoid!

- Omega 3 fatty acids are another family of polyunsaturated fats that are mainly anti-inflammatory. Omega 3 fatty acids decrease thrombosis (blood clots) and are believed to protect against heart disease.
    

=> Flax seeds, walnuts and oily fish such as sardines and salmon are all good sources.

- Saturated fats are so named because they are saturated with hydrogen. This makes them chemically stable. The polyunsaturated fats, like most vegetable oils, have “holes” where the hydrogen is “missing.” They are less stable chemically, so they have a tendency to go rancid and have a short shelf life. The solution was to create artificial trans fats. 
    

=> Watch labels for Hydrogenated Fats as these fats are infused with hydrogen to extend shelf life.

- Eat moderate amounts of proteins: These are more satiating and have a smaller effect on insulin.
    

- Proteins differ greatly in their capacity to stimulate insulin.  
    Whey protein stimulates it a lot. Muscle meat also (we eating only muscle meat can be compared to drinking fruit juice. Eat more whole meat (liver, bone broth, etc)
    
- Eat whole, unprocessed foods: Focus on natural, nutrient-dense options to support overall health.
    

## When to eat:

- Incorporate intermittent fasting: Periods of fasting allow insulin levels to drop, enabling fat burning and weight loss.
    
- Don’t snack. Constant eating does not allow insulin to drop. Stick to 2 or 3 times per day.
    

# 6. The Role of Other Factors

- Stress: Chronic stress increases cortisol levels, which can raise insulin and promote fat storage.
    
- Sleep: Poor sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite (ghrelin and leptin), increasing cravings and hunger.

# Actionable Steps:

1. Cut out refined carbs and sugars, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods.
    
2. Increase consumption of healthy fats, maintain moderate levels of protein.
    
3. Incorporate intermittent fasting, such as the 16:8 method (16 hours fasting, 8-hour eating window), 24-hour fasting, or 36 hour fasting. Breakfast is not the most important meal of the day. Skip it if you don’t feel very hungry.
    
4. Don’t snack, sticking to two or three meals per day.
    
5. Reduce stress through mindfulness or relaxation techniques.
    
6. Prioritize sleep to regulate hunger hormones.
