## "Deny karma"
When you realize yourself as a child of God, what karma have you?
God has no karma, and you have none - when you know you are his child, everyday you should affirm: I am not a mortal being. I am not the body, I am a child of God.
God is free from karma, you are made in his image -> you are also free of karma.
Bring the light in, and you will feel that darkness never was.
If light is admitted to a cave where darkness has existed for thousands of years, darkness will vanish instantly, so will our faults and weaknesses will vanish instantly when we bring in the light of God. The darkness of ignorance can enter never more. 

Everything that the world gives you, and then takes away, leaving you in pain or disillusionment, you will find in God in a much greater way, and with no aftermath or sorrow.

Catch God in the net of unconditional love. Do not despair if you do not yet feel an unconditional love for God - salvation is for all. 

The human form is the mud that you have put over your soul and that is why you do not know what you are. Wash away the mud, forget the body by meditation and you will know what you are.
How can you be anything but perfect since you are God's child? 
Be like the great ones, who inwardly think constantly of the beauty behind the flowers, the light behind the sun, the life that twinkles in all eyes, that beats in every heart, the motion that walks in all feet, that works in all hands, the mind that is working through all brains, the love that is behind all loves. 

God is so great - so marvelous. To live in the mind of the divine consciousness is to see this mundane world ignorant of God as a nightmare, and to have eternal freedom form its terrors. God is freedom from all misery. God is the health and the wealth you seek. God is the love you seek. 

God is the Goal you seek. All things you desire, you will find in him. He is playing hide and seek - someday he will say - i hid from long you not to torture you, but to make our reunion in the end bright and beautiful. 


Be a jailbreaker from the prison of fate. Although life seems capricious, uncertain and full of all types of troubles, we are always under the guiding, loving protection of God.
We are in a jail - imprisoned by the consequences of our wrong actions, but we can break out of this prison and be one with God again. We are surrounded by the bars of fate, evil, moral troubles, weaknesses, sickness and financial difficulties, we have the power within us to split them apart.
**i am the conquerer of all. I may die, but i will die free. i will not remain behind the bars of bad habits, fate**.
not God, but you created the jail - you must therefore break them. You must be Jailbreakers, breaking out of the prison of flesh. Escape from every jail cell of bad habits, attachment, emotion, desires, life and death. Bars can be severed with the saw of wisdom. The more you will saw at them with meditation, the freer you will become through the power of God.
In him, you will know that this life is just a dream. it is just a drama.

Affirmations for meditation:
**I will keep on seeking God, even if i drop dread **trying.** 
Meditate on God. 
**I, and my father, are one. I am a child of God.**
- Medidate until you feel a great joy. When joy strikes your hear, God has answered your broadcast. He is responding to your prayers and positive thinking.
**Father, though art with me. I command your power within me, to cauterize (burn) my braincells of wrong habits, and past seed tendencies.** 
	the power of Godin meditation will do it. Rid yourself of the limiting consciousness that you are a man or a woman. Know that you are a child of God. 
**I command my braincells to change, to destroy the bad habits that have made a puppet out of me. Lord, burn them up in your Divine Light.**
